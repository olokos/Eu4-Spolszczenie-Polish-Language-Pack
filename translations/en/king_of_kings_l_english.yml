 byz_roman_empire_desc: "We are the true Roman Empire, created as a result of the west-east split and the only surviving remnant. The so-called 'Holy Roman Emperors' are none of those things and the pretenders to our rule in Constantinople are just that - foolish pretenders."

 BYZ_false_despots_desc: "The Despotate of Epirus was established as one of the remnants of the Byzantine Empire following the disaster of 1204. However, it would in time fall under the control of the Neapolitans, further bolstering the Latin influence in Greece. This stronghold must be wiped out!"
 BYZ_magna_graecia_title: "Recover Magna Graecia"
 BYZ_magna_graecia_desc: "Magna Graecia, the territories settled by Greek Colonies in ancient times, have long been lost to the decline of our Empire. With competent leadership and a powerful navy, it is time to retake those territories and reinstate Roman government in the southern tip of Italy."
 BYZ_carthage_title: "Exarchate of Africa"
 BYZ_carthage_desc: "The Roman Province of Africa has long been a core territory of the Roman Empire. Upon the Empire's division, it would in no less than a century fall under the rule of the Vandals. It would once again be brought to Roman Lands thanks to Justinian's ambitions. Then it would fall to the Caliphate in 7th century."
 BYZ_impending_doom_title: "The Impending Doom"
 BYZ_impending_doom_desc: "The Empire is at the brink of destruction. Every Roman citizen is silently aware that the end is nigh, and the days of Roman glory are already numbered. But is there really no hope for the crumbling empire? With the emperors struggling to make alliances with the west and seeking support, there might still be a chance for recovery."
 BYZ_bar_title: "Vengeance at Bar"
 BYZ_bar_desc: "The disastrous Battle of Bar ensured the Serbian realm was to remain independent from the Byzantine Empire for years to come. While we did manage to strike back at the Serbians since then, they were still able to take over much of our territory and did found the Serbian Empire. Since then, they have succumbed to decline of their own as well. Let us strike them while they are still down!"
 BYZ_illyria_title: "Advance into Illyricum"

 BYZ_belisarius_foe_desc: "The war against Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy is one of the crowning achievements of Justinian's rule and proof of the military prowess of his general, Belisarius. The struggle against the Ostrogoths proved to be long and exhausting, but it was ultimately successful."
 BYZ_justinians_ambition_title: "Justinian's Ambition"
 BYZ_justinians_ambition_desc: "The rule of Justinian, one of the most revered Eastern Roman Emperors, was one of glory and success. It is during his rule that the most successful attempt was made at bringing the Roman Empire back to a reality."
 BYZ_iberia_title: "Non Plus Ultra"
 BYZ_iberia_desc: "To the west lies the strait of Gibraltar, surrounded by the two Pillars of Hercules. The Romans of old believed that beyond Iberia there lies nothing.

Let our forces march and claim Hispania with its colonies as rightful Roman territory."
 BYZ_greece_title: "Reverse the Downfall"
 BYZ_greece_desc: "The Roman Empire has been consistently declining for about a millennium now. With small periods of recovery from time to time, today we may be lying at the definitive end of our journey. With the Ottoman encroaching and lusting for the city of world's desire, the end is looming. While the Ottomans are still occupied, let us strike and bolster our hold in Greece - our most core territory."
 BYZ_bulgaria_title: "Reconquer Bulgaria"
 BYZ_bulgaria_desc: "While we may have succeeded in retaking Greece from Ottoman hold, the second fight may not be any better. Let us hope the Bulgarian nobles oppose their Muslim overlords more than our rule, exposing themselves to our influence once again."
 BYZ_aegean_islands_title: "Repulse the Republics"
 BYZ_aegean_islands_desc: "As our state expands and finds itself in a stronger position, the presence of the Latin Republics in our vicinity turns to be more of an impediment than support. It is time to end our lip service to the merchants. The Aegean islands belong to us and our [Root.GetBurghersName]."
 BYZ_venetian_avarice_title: "Venetian Avarice"
 BYZ_venetian_avarice_desc: "Constantinople fell victim to a siege by the Catholics in 1204. Sacked by Crusaders, who were initially intending to battle Muslims to the east, they would later betray their ideals and turn their attention towards our city and with the support from the treacherous Venetians, the megalopolis would fall to their combined forces in April of that accursed year. The capture would lead to a period of sacking when an innumerable amount of riches and priceless icons were stolen from the Queen of Cities. The Fall of Constantinople led to the establishment of Latin Empire, whose rule was called frankokratia. That period, albeit short, would accelerate the decline and further weaken the empire."
 BYZ_france_title: "Beyond the Alps"
 BYZ_france_desc: "Beyond the Northern mountains of Italy lie the lands in Gallia, nowadays referred moreso as France, where the descendants of the Gauls and invading Germanic Tribes rule a powerful kingdom. Let us muster the forces from Italy and conquer that kingdom which is suffering from delusions of imperial ambitions."
 BYZ_france_ct: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on all provinces in §YBritain§!, §YLow Countries§! and §YWest Germany§! needed for the §YRestore the Roman Empire§! decision."
 BYZ_roman_empire_title: "Basileia Rhomaion"
 BYZ_roman_empire_desc: "It has been over a millennium since the two Roman Empires were still united. Split in 395, there were hopes that the act would help stop the decline of the Empire and its political system. Instead, the western half would fall in 476 and eastern half would almost fall to the Ottomans in 15th century. Nobody back then would have believed that the heirs of the Eastern monarchs would rule an Empire whole again. The proclamation of the restored Roman Empire is deserving of a great Triumph in Rome itself."
 BYZ_coast_title: "Asia Minor"
 BYZ_coast_desc: "Though already long conquered and settled by the Ottoman Turks, the western edges of Anatolia are still somewhat core territory of ours. With many Greeks living in the cities and in coastal towns, the reconquest of those territories could prove beneficial to strengthening our maritime commerce and general strength."
 BYZ_avenge_1071_title: "Avenge 1071"
 BYZ_avenge_1071_desc: "130 years prior to Fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders, the Roman Empire suffered a tragic defeat on the fields of Manzikert, sealing the fate of Roman Anatolia. Following this loss, Anatolia would come to be permanently settled by the Turks, fierce opponents, and rivals to our state. Having driven them out of Greece and Eastern Asia Minor, we should bring an end to their rule in the entirety of Anatolia."
 BYZ_syria_title: "Antiochia & Jerusalem"
 BYZ_syria_desc: "Syria is home to two of the Pentarchy seats. Settled since ancient times, home to Jesus Christ himself, we must take full control of the province and restore this important region back to the Roman Empire."
 BYZ_egypt_title: "Into Aegyptus"
 BYZ_egypt_desc: "Holding the Bishopric of Alexandria and the delta of the Nile, Egypt is critical to [Root.GetName] for more reasons than one. To take full control of this province should be our utmost priority and the rule over it is bound to bring us obscene wealth and power. We will unleash its potential and all those before us shall be treated as those who could not wield the true power the region provides."
 BYZ_breadbasket_title: "The Breadbasket"
 BYZ_breadbasket_desc: "The Nile is the lifeline of the Egyptian civilization. Providing an outstanding supply of irrigation and therefore food, with this great river any civilization can grow in population. Having reconquered the area, let us exploit the Nile to its fullest."
 BYZ_pontic_empire_title: "Princes of the Lazes"
 BYZ_pontic_empire_desc: "Following the disastrous fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders in 1204, many minor splinters of the Empire have formed. One of them was the Komnenos realm formed in Pontus. Claiming to be the rightful heirs, they are mere pretenders destined to be destroyed. Their rule mostly extends over the Laz people. They are no emperors, but mere princes!"
 BYZ_persians_title: "Abase the Persians"
 BYZ_persians_desc: "The Roman Empire has a history of centuries full of feuds with the Persians over supremacy in Mesopotamia and Caucasia. Let us move in and deal a decisive blow to their ambitions and pride, forever thwarting their plans for lands west of the Zagros Mountains. They need to be humiliated!"
 BYZ_mesopotamia_title: "Follow the Rivers"
 BYZ_mesopotamia_desc: "One of the cradles of civilization that is Mesopotamia is surrounded by strong enemies and lacks natural barriers. Let us ensure that it is no other great power's playground but ours. Persians shall have no say in those matters!"
 BYZ_mecca_title: "The Heart of Islam"
 BYZ_mecca_desc: "Mecca is the center point for the Muslim Community. Home to the first Caliphate that has taken vast swathes of territories from our crumbling empire, it would be most ironic for us to seize their most holy of cities. Even more ironic it would be to convert it to a church."
 BYZ_economic_independence_title: "Economic Independence"
 BYZ_economic_independence_desc: "After 1204, the successive Emperors tried to make Byzantine markets into an invaluable asset of the Latin merchants, granting them various privileges and excluding them from the kommerkion - 10% customs tax on goods arriving in Constantinople. This had the disastrous effect of destroying our merchants' trust and letting them be outcompeted. Let us reclaim those markets."
 BYZ_return_to_gold_title: "Return to Gold"
 BYZ_return_to_gold_desc: "In the past, the Eastern Roman Empire would commit to minting gold coins for the subject. However, with loss of gold and silver mines, it would become increasingly difficult to strike such coins. The last gold coin to be struck was hyperperon, and even it would succumb to the usual fate of being debased to support military campaigns."
 BYZ_support_weavers_title: "Support the Weavers"
 BYZ_support_weavers_desc: "Silk-weaving has a relatively long history in Byzantium. With the smuggling of silkworms in sixth century, the art of sericulture has persisted for a millennium and various guilds of weavers have formed in larger cities. Let us support them and provide them with markets for their goods."
 BYZ_tarnished_state_title: "A Tarnished State"
 BYZ_tarnished_state_desc: "Our state has become tarnished by war and depopulation. Constant civil wars and conflicts have depleted our most invaluable asset - population. Let our lands be devastated no more and let the vacant homes not be empty any longer."
 BYZ_book_of_the_eparch_title: "Book of the Prefect"
 BYZ_book_of_the_eparch_desc: "With a growing number of merchants in the Queen of all cities, let us create new manuals and records to keep track of the local burghers. With so many guilds and exceptions, it is imperative the future eparchs have the experience to deal with them."
 BYZ_at_least_10_production_income: "At least §Y10.0§!¤ Monthly Income from §YProduction§!."
 BYZ_glass_ware_title: "Glass Wares of Byzantium"
 BYZ_glass_ware_desc: "The glassmaking of the eastern romans has been nothing short of incredible. Famous across Europe along with the imperial silks, it would influence the Venetian Crystal and give rise to many other styles in the process. But since the Latin merchants have taken over our markets, this art seems to have been lost to time, only remaining significant in Constantinople. Let us rectify that."
 BYZ_city_of_worlds_desire_title: "City of World's Desire"
 BYZ_city_of_worlds_desire_desc: "Constantinople, the seat of Eastern Roman Empire, bears many names and nicknames. From Byzantium through New Rome, all the way to 'Queen of Cities', the most fitting nickname will always remain to be 'The City of World's Desire', which perfectly exemplifies the envy of the surrounding states."
 BYZ_megalopolis_title: "The Megalopolis"
 BYZ_megalopolis_desc: "The Byzantine Population was among the most centralized of its time. The inside of Constantinopolitan walls was bustling with life and the city has grown to massive numbers. With the Emperor's court within the city, it was simply economically and politically beneficial to settle in the city. As we restore our Empire, this concentration of wealth is bound to reoccur."
 BYZ_royal_purple_title: "The Royal Purple"
 BYZ_royal_purple_desc: "Yet the most iconic of all Byzantine symbols has to be the Royal Purple dye. Tyrian Purple garments were the symbol of royalty and royal offspring would be born in a room glazed with purple rock, exceedingly rare at the time. The dye would be produced in several spots across the Empire, but the yields were never high, and availability remained limited. Let us restore the color to the Roman royalty."
 BYZ_promote_the_merchants_title: "Promote the [Root.GetBurghersName]"
 BYZ_promote_the_merchants_desc: "With our betrayal that we have inflicted upon our [Root.GetBurghersName], the trust between them and the state has become seriously strained. Let us rectify the mistakes of old and give them hope in our rule."
 BYZ_collect_our_profits_title: "Collect our Profits"
 BYZ_collect_our_profits_desc: "With our support of the merchants and loans provided to the manufacturers, it is high time we collected the interest on them. We reap what we sow, and we are about to feast on the fruits of our labor."
 BYZ_warehouse_of_the_east_title: "Warehouse of the East"
 BYZ_warehouse_of_the_east_desc: "With our support of manufacturers and the massive growth of cities and guilds, we have risen to a rank of manufacturing Entrepôt. With many prized goods originating right here, the Romans aren't just famous for their long and rich history, but also for the beauty of their fabrics that remains affordable to all."
 BYZ_peloponesian_renaissance_title: "Peloponnesian Renaissance"
 BYZ_peloponesian_renaissance_desc: "While Constantinople was in imminent danger of an invasion, a fraction of the Byzantine scholars has made Morea their home, giving the peninsula a true rebirth. Originating from Peloponnese was Gemistos Plethon, a philosopher who studied the works of Plato and had deep connections to the old beliefs."
 BYZ_monemvasian_merchants_title: "Monemvasian Merchants"
 BYZ_monemvasian_merchants_desc: "Monemvasia is a town off the eastern coast of Peloponnese. Situated in a unique position, the site became a local trade center, giving rise to several merchant families, among them the Notaras."
 BYZ_thessaly_title: "Trade in Thessaloniki"
 BYZ_thessaly_desc: "Thessaloniki would for a long time remain the secondary capital for the empire, fulfilling both political and maritime functions. Let us restore the city to its former glories!"
 BYZ_wealth_from_the_east_title: "Wealth from the East"
 BYZ_wealth_from_the_east_desc: "As the Empire expands to its old territories, the old trade routes become lively again. We have focused on bringing our core territories to their former selves, but we should do the same to the rest of the former empire! The wealth of the east should once again flow to Constantinople forevermore."
 BYZ_church_in_distress_title: "Church in Distress"
 BYZ_church_in_distress_desc: "The rightful Church is in distress. Greatly anxious regarding the monarch's decision to enter a union with Rome, the clergy is highly upset, with many priests downright defying the emperor. The faith in the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty must be restored."
 BYZ_muscovite_autocephaly_title: "Curb Russian Autocephaly"
 BYZ_muscovite_autocephaly_desc: "Following the declaration regarding union of the churches, many bishops in other realms have chosen to sever their ties with us, instead choosing to declare Autocephaly and independence from the patriarch in Constantinople. Among them were the undisputed leaders of this movement in Russia. Let us coerce them to bring them back into the fold."
 BYZ_mend_the_schism_title: "Mend the Schism"
 BYZ_mend_the_schism_desc: "As a result of conflicts between the Roman supremacy and our rightful belief in equal rights, the supporters of Rome have severed their ties, causing a schism in the church in 1054. With excommunications placed on each other, both churches remain separate to this day. Only our force may rectify that."
 BYZ_church_authority_title: "Recover Authority"
 BYZ_church_authority_desc: "While we have curbed the anxiety of our priests, the average citizen's belief in the Monarch and Church has plummeted. We need to reassure the population who has been divinely chosen to lead them and this wave of impiety must be stopped."
 BYZ_new_synods_title: "New Synods"
 BYZ_new_synods_desc: "In the few centuries following Jesus' lifetime, the religious community of bishops has gathered in many Synods to discuss the faith in depth. With the evolution of the world, culture and changes in the socioeconomic sphere, it might be worthwhile to continue this tradition."
 BYZ_pentarchy_title: "Restore the Pentarchy"
 BYZ_pentarchy_desc: "Before the collapse of our Empire, the five Patriarchs in Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Rome and Constantinople used to live in relative peace and unity, convening on matters when necessary and serving our ecclesiastical community. Let's bring the golden age back."
 BYZ_reinforce_constantinople_title: "Reinforce Constantinople"
 BYZ_reinforce_constantinople_desc: "The mighty Theodosian Walls are in disrepair and the Ottoman threat in looming. We need to take action, lest we see our walls crumble like brittle glass."
 BYZ_defence_in_depth_title: "Defense in Depth"
 BYZ_defence_in_depth_desc: "If we want to hold an impenetrable defense, relying on just one aspect is not going to be enough of an assurance. We need multiple sets of walls and multiple plans in order to be prepared for any knavish trick our foes might have prepared."
 BYZ_hexamilion_title: "Hexamilion Wall"
 BYZ_hexamilion_desc: "The Hexamilion wall used to protect the isthmus in ancient times. Recently, the wall has been repaired to protect against the Ottomans, but that has failed too. We must either commit or give up on it."
 BYZ_theme_system_title: "The Theme System"
 BYZ_theme_system_desc: "The Theme System used to be our form of civilian and military governance. Due to the sudden decline in territory, the need for themes has been rendered non-existent. Let us restore this system for good."
 BYZ_restore_navy_title: "Restore Byzantine Navy"
 BYZ_restore_navy_desc: "The fall of importance of Dromon, supremacy of the Latin Galea, and our dependence on the Latin Republics for naval support has led to our fleet being essentially nought. With our shackles thrown, let us once again arm ourselves on the seas."
 BYZ_greek_fire_title: "Sea Fire"
 BYZ_greek_fire_desc: "The Greek Fire, known under many names by the Greeks, was among the most important innovations aiding the Eastern Roman Empire. It is the name for a substance that was discharged onto enemy ships and lit on fire, serving as an early flamethrower. This gave the Byzantine navy a significant edge over its maritime rivals, until the practice ceased when the sources of its ingredients were lost."

 BYZ_foreign_officers_desc: "The general lack of manpower and skilled generals is evident. While not beneficial to the general state of the army, hiring foreign officers and their companies could bolster our reserves and staff."
 BYZ_decentralized_pronoia_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Pronoia Rights[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_decentralized_pronoia_desc: "The Pronoiars are mostly hereditary landholders who have been rewarded for their loyal military service. Perhaps the system could see amendments to improve their capabilities, perhaps mimicking the Ottoman Timars."
 BYZ_strategoi_realms_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Realms of the Strategoi[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_strategoi_realms_desc: "Through our choices the army has evolved into a decentralized collection of native and foreign generals, holding mostly hereditary tracts of land, where they recruit from the local population and give lands to their most loyal soldiers."

 BYZ_centralized_pronoia_desc: "Pronoiars are mostly landowners whose land has been granted for military service. Initially non-inheritable, the posts would later become hereditary as being a pronoiar was no longer that special. This institution is of great service to our military, but it does require immediate reform."
 BYZ_reform_the_themata_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Reform the Themata[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_reform_the_themata_desc: "While Theme System functions, it is woefully outdated to modern needs. We need to reform it to better suit the future - an age of gunpowder and standing armies."
 BYZ_varangian_guard_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]The Varangian Guard[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_varangian_guard_desc: "The Varangian Guard was an elite unit within our military. Initially comprised of Viking mercenaries, it would later be reinforced by Anglo-Saxons. The unit would get integrated into the greater society and would cease to exist as a separate regiment. Many were claiming to be Varangians in the 1400s. It is time to restore this famous unit and modernize it."

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.1.t: "The Reconquest of Serbia"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.1.d: "The lands that used to be core parts of the Serbian Realm once belonged to the Romans. Due to their delusions of independence, we had to fight many wars to keep them down and it took them many struggles to eventually split off from the realm. With the rise of the Serbian Empire, the country would become a decisive player, though they too, have been touched with cold grip of wither. Today, having recovered, we stand victorious above the magnates, whose ancestors so treacherously betrayed us."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.1.a: "Their treachery will not end here. Deal with them accordingly!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.1.b: "Let them keep their possessions."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.2.t: "The Grikos of Italy"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.2.d: "Since antiquity, the territories of southern Italy have been inhabited by Greeks, whose ancestors were settlers arriving from the east. Those peoples would see themselves reunited with the rest of the Greek world during the brief Byzantine rule, but even that tie would sever with the recession of the Eastern Roman Empire. Today, those territories are once again held by a Hellenic government, giving reassurances to the local population that their identity and rich history will be preserved under this new rule. Support of the Grikos is sure to bolster our hold of the area."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.2.a: "Now reconnected to our Metropolis!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.3.t: "Belisarius' Successor"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.3.d: "Our conquest of the Lombards has seen many great soldiers rise through the ranks. Many of them have already acquired the status of strategoi, earning fame through their valor. But there can only be one successor to Belisarius, the primary general of Emperor Justinian, whose skillful command has allowed him to temporarily claim the mantle of Rome and to bring the shattered Roman world together. There are four primary candidates for this post; a learned student of the strategikon, a brave, inspiring leader, an excellent siege specialist and a man professing brilliant strategic thinking."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.3.a: "His successor will have studied the art of war."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.3.b: "May his heir lead the charge!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.3.c: "He shall fell castles like trees."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.3.e: "His successor shall be a brilliant strategist."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.4.t: "Rome in Roman Hands"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.4.d: "The last time a Roman Empire held the eternal city was in 751, over seven centuries ago. Since then and until now, it had been held by the Papal States, spiritually presiding over all of Catholicism. It cannot be said the city was left unmaintained, but it certainly has not seen the desired growth. As of today, the city once again lies in Roman hands, but the population does not consider themselves Roman. But with how grandiose our army's crossing into Rome was, the die has been cast and we shall sooner falter than to let Italy go."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.4.a: "Alea iacta est."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.5.t: "Return to the Past"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.5.d: "With the reconquest of Rome, its beauty has once again reinvigorated the minds of our artists. The city that was once the center of the greatest empire the world has ever seen. Moving the capital back there would be a great service to our ancestors, while also being a clear sign that we are here to stay, and that restoration of the Empire soon shall commence."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.5.a: "Let the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] reign in Rome."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.5.b: "Let us remain in [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.6.t: "Recovery of Greece"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.6.d: "Against all odds and defying all expectations, our state was able to hold off the advance of the Ottomans, while taking the initiative and striking back. The territories of Greece, a core part of the Roman Realm, slowly lost due to the withering state of the empire, now once again belong to us."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.6.a: "Like a phoenix, we rise."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.7.t: "Effects of the Pronoia Policies in [Root.GetName]"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.7.d: "Pronoia System was a collection of policies upon which military servicemen were granted lands across the Empire to ensure their loyal service. Such policy has been applied in [Root.GetName], leading to the slow and rather unexpected conversion of the province to Greek culture."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.7.a: "Alright."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.8.t: "Memories of Manzikert"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.8.d: "At long last, much of Anatolia is once again held by us. Many of those territories have had their traditional Ottoman Timars kept in place to ensure stability and ease the administration. Having essentially eliminated the Ottoman State though, we can turn the attention to them and finally decide what to do with their lands and their past service to the Sultans."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.8.a: "Let the Timar holders retain their lands."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.8.b: "Grant the lands to Greek pronoiars."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.8.c: "Let us reverse the Devshirme on them."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.9.t: "Fate of the Masjid al-Haram"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.9.d: "The Holiest Cities of Islam lie at our mercy. Once the origins of our fiercest rivals, today mere pawns in our hands. Alongside the cities themselves, the holiest sites of Islam are within our grasp. Many from upper command have proposed to convert the holiest Mosque of Masjid al-Haram into a church. Had the Muslims conquered Hagia Sophia, we are sure they would have done the same to our beloved church."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.9.a: "Convert the Mosque into a Church!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.9.b: "Allow the Muslims to make pilgrimages as usual."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.10.t: "The Pontic Empire"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.10.d: "It has been several centuries since the Pontus was united with the rest of the Empire. Ruled by the successors to the deposed Komnenos, their state claims the Emperorship and is desperately trying to survive. Now ruling mostly over Lazes, we are about to end their pretension to the crown."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.10.a: "There is only one Roman Empire!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.11.t: "The Hexamilion Wall"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.11.d: "The six-mile wall at the isthmus of Corinth has been in continuous maintenance by our engineers for centuries. Unfortunately, due to regular Ottoman excursions, it has been pierced repeatedly in 1423 and 1431. Ottoman demands are to cease the efforts at restoring this wall, but truth is that such demands are unacceptable."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.11.a: "Defy the Ottomans! Reconstruct the wall."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.11.b: "We shall focus on our capital."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.12.t: "Defensive Mentality"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.12.d: "Constantinople can be considered to be under constant siege. Though at peace, truth is that the Ottoman ambition will eventually unleash hordes of Janissaries upon the city. If the city is to brave such an assault, we will need to have the Theodosian Walls repaired and reinforced."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.12.a: "Let us ask the Serbians for help."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.12.b: "Tax the citizens, we need their help."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.12.c: "The walls don't need the repairs."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.13.t: "Upgrade for Hexamilion Wall Complete"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.13.d: "Thanks to our efforts and considerable amount of financial support, we were able to reinforce and strengthen the defensive capabilities on the walls at the Isthmus of Corinth."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.13.a: "Great news."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.14.t: "Upgrade for Theodosian Walls Complete"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.14.d: "The upgrade to mighty Theodosian Walls that protect our beloved city is finally complete. There is no force that may pierce these walls, no trebuchet, no assault weapon. Only a powerful cannon could deal damage to those, but those are rare and expensive, something the Ottomans surely aren't capable of mustering."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.14.a: "Let the Turks come!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.15.t: "Byzantine Request"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.15.d: "The Byzantines have sent us a delegation, seeking to negotiate a monetary contribution to the repair of the Theodosian Walls. As an enemy of their enemy, we should seriously consider such proposal, for once Constantinople falls - we are sure to be next. Supporting the Romans may also result in an ally who could come to our aid, should the Ottomans decide to strike preemptively."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.15.a: "We will donate everything we have."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.15.b: "Send a moderate amount."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.15.c: "We can only give a modest amount."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.15.e: "They do not deserve a coin."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.16.t: "Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Asserts Authority"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.16.d: "With the Russian Church declaring Autocephaly, it would seem the Eastern Church was about to fragment itself, forever remaining disunited across various Bishops. This couldn't have been more wrong, for we have managed to restore the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople to his former authority and successfully coerced the most powerful of Orthodox Bishops to respect his will."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.16.a: "Respect his authority or face heavenly punishment!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.17.t: "Restoration of the Pentarchy"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.17.d: "The Eastern Orthodox Church has been continuously falling to decline. Forever tarnished by the Arab Invasions and Schism of 1054, it seemed like the Pentarchy was a thing of the past. Thankfully, [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]'s ambition brought it back together, and the five Patriarchs may once again convene, uniting Christians into one."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.17.a: "The East is whole again."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.18.t: "Ecumenical Council"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.18.d: "As per the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s request, all Five of the Patriarchs have gathered in [byz_council_prov.GetName] to discuss matters relating to the faith and unity. Among the topics is a debate on the printing of the Bible, a recent discussion regarding religious doctrine, and an attempt by the Patriarch of Constantinople to centralize his power."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.18.a: "We must have strict control on the printing."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.18.b: "We must resolve the debate on religious doctrine."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.18.c: "Support the Patriarch of Constantinople."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.19.t: "The Notaras Family"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.19.d: "The Notaras Family is a notable merchant family originating from Monemvasia. Besides producing many prominent merchants who travel far and wide, the most famous of them all is Loukas Notaras - selected to be the megas doux - chief commander of the Byzantine Navy."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.19.a: "Recruit Loukas."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.19.b: "Recruit a prominent merchant."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.21.t: "Byzantine Merchants Regain Prominence"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.21.d: "Since the State started caving in to the requests of the Latin Merchants, the position of the Byzantine trader has been getting increasingly incomparable to the state of the foreign one. Thankfully, thanks to the policies of state, this course has been reversed, lending our merchants with increasing control over domestic and foreign markets."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.21.a: "Invest in the Ships."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.21.b: "Let us negotiate good loans."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.21.c: "Provide them with more freedoms!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.22.t: "Royal Purple"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.22.d: "The Tyrian Purple has become a symbol of the Eastern Roman Empire. With the growing economic health of our state and subsequent enrichment, the state has reached such wealth that even our borders are painted purple on royal maps."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.22.a: "Keep our color!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.22.b: "Revel in the glory."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.23.t: "Trade Good Change"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.23.d: "A growing number of burghers in [Root.GetName] are beginning to take up an interest in a new industry. Many have already begun to toil themselves with it, forming new guilds and getting interested in their products. This situation could very well be a thrilling opportunity."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.23.a: "Follow up with these developments!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.23.b: "The current industry is too precious."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.24.t: "Byzantine Mosaicists"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.24.d: "In the days of the golden age, our cities used to overflow with the number of skilled Mosaicists. So much so, that they traveled abroad, taking their skills with them. A similar thing has begun to happen now, except now we could ease travel for some, providing we get monetary favors in return."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.24.a: "Let us send them to our friends in [byz_mosaicists_ally.GetName]."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.24.b: "Offer the service to the mighty [byz_mosaicists_powerful.GetName]."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.24.c: "They should seek the services of [byz_mosaicists_wealthy.GetName]."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.24.e: "We need their services!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.25.t: "Offer from [From.GetName]"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.25.d: "An envoy from [From.GetName] has reached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], offering the service of their Mosaicists, highly valued and renowned for their expertise. Should we accept the offer, their work will enrich our greatest national monuments for years to come."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.25.a: "We will accept such an arrangement!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.25.b: "We have neither the funds nor the will to agree."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.26.t: "Growing Foreign Demand for Silks"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.26.d: "The fame and notoriety of Roman silks across Western Europe has been a real phenomenon. Unfortunately, as the Empire began to decline, so did its ability to set the standards for foreign fashion. Worse yet, foreign clothes and silks have actually eclipsed the prestige of the Roman ones in decades leading up to 15th century. Thankfully, this notion has been reversed, and our silks once again set the standard. This has led to a heavy increase in demand, boosting the prices."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.26.a: "Obviously!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.27.t: "The Themata"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.27.d: "The Theme System has been serving us since the seventh century and has remained present to this day, albeit at a reduced size, due to the territorial decline of the Empire. With reconquests of the Eastern Roman territories well underway, it would be wise to redraw the themata borders and adapt to the new environments."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.27.a: "Let us reform it!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.27.b: "The time is not right."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.28.t: "Handle Branching Missions"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.28.d: "Our army lies at a crossroads. Having trifled with many army management decisions in the past, there is a set example to follow, in case we opt for a centralized or decentralized approach."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.28.a: "We have chosen."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.28.b: "It might be preferable to lead with wealth."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.28.c: "The reliance of mercenaries was disastrous!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.28.e: "I need to consult the Strategikon."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.29.t: "Future of the Pronoia System"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.29.d: "Pronoia System is a policy of land grants to various persons and institutions, including monasteries, government officials but most importantly, military servicemen. Indeed, it is the soldiers and generals that have always been at the center of the system. Pronoia grants were given as a reward for servitude and as a means to ensure continuous loyalty. Initially, non-inheritable, they would later become hereditary. As our state continues to exist, this system keeps evolving, lately adopting some aspects of Ottoman Timar system."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.29.a: "We must get ready to grant out more territories."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.29.b: "Integrate the Pronoiar armies into our forces."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.29.c: "Let them handle themselves."

To ensure such outcome, let us construct a castle on the European side of the Bosporus, north of Constantinople and opposite the Anadoluhisari, lying on the other side of the strait. With both of those castles, we will be able to control the flow of ships in the narrow sound, nullifying much of Byzantine naval support while also extracting a toll. The fort's name shall be Rumelihisari. The fortress also received the name 'Bogazkesen' or 'Strait Cutter'."

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.35.d: "The Byzantines have taken notice of our unwillingness to continue paying tribute for Orhan Celebi, an Ottoman pretender kept in [151.GetName]. We will not be intimidated! Though, a civil war at the wrong time could be disastrous."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.35.a: "Let them try."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.35.b: "Very well, pay them off!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.36.t: "Ottoman Refusal"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.36.d: "The vile Ottoman Sultan has refused our demands, prompting fury and panic in [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s court. Many call for sponsoring Orhan as an Ottoman Pretender, a tactic applied by the Ottomans and Byzantines against each other in the past, leading to tumultuous civil wars for the Byzantines."

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.38.d: "Centuries of exhaustion, depopulation, and disasters have shrunk the city of Constantinople so much so, that within the walls itself there was much farmland. Thankfully, this trend has seen a reversal and the city has now managed to outgrow these walls, climbing in population numbers."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.38.a: "Great news!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.39.t: "Campaign into Thessaly"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.39.d: "Constantine, one of the Despots of Morea at the time, has decided to join forces with Western support and to move against Ottomans in Thessaly. While ultimately a failure, it would give Constantine invaluable experience in war and would raise the morale of his forces."

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.39.b: "Let him campaign himself."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.40.t: "Punitive Expedition"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.40.d: "In 1444, Constantine, one of the Despots of Morea, launched an expedition against us in Thessaly. Though we have already stopped their advance, this incursion is unacceptable. Many have called for action to be taken and have called for sending a fully-fledged punitive expedition."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.40.a: "Send the expedition."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.40.b: "Their petty army will do no harm."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.41.t: "Byzantine Merchants Evade Taxes"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.41.d: "Frustrated by having to pay full Kommerkion, a 10% customs tax in Constantinople, many Byzantine Merchants have taken the rather shrewd tactic of employing the help of Latin Merchants, who are exempt from the tax in order to evade it, severely harming our finances. Many Byzantine traders regularly complain about the unfair treatment and lack of protectionism."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.41.a: "Crackdown on the practice!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.41.b: "Grant the tax exemptions to them as well."

Thankfully, civil war has been narrowly avoided thanks to the widow of the deceased emperor. Nevertheless, the shadow of Demetrios' ambition will continue to haunt [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reign."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.42.a: "Crisis narrowly avoided."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.43.t: "Ottoman Troops Haul Ships"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.43.d: "In order to avoid the chain blockade of the Golden Horn, the Ottoman troops have decided to haul their ships across the land. Using greasy logs, the forces towed the ships like the Rus' have done several centuries prior. This will greatly weaken Constantinople's naval defensive capabilities."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.43.a: "Golden Horn is exposed!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.44.t: "Walls of Constantinople"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.44.d: "It is believed that mighty Theodosian Walls can withstand any assault. That may be true, but what they certainly cannot stand is the massive cannonballs cast by the cannons constructed with Urban's help."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.44.a: "No one can stand our cannons!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.45.t: "Fall of Constantinople"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.45.d: "The City of World's Desire has finally fallen and is now firmly in our grip. Despite this, the Palaiologos still continue to fight and resist in Morea, their other dominion. However, ruled by greedy and envious brothers, we might have a chance of breaking through their will by promises and simple intimidation."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.45.a: "We will annihilate all remnants of Byzantium."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.45.b: "Demand the Despots' surrender!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.46.t: "Ottomans Advance on Morea"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.46.d: "The Ottoman Sultan, [From.Monarch.GetName], has offered the Palaiologos brothers a proposition. Should we cease our resistance, we will be able to retain our rule, albeit as vassals."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.46.a: "Wave the white flag."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.46.b: "We will fight!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.47.t: "Anti-Unionist Revolt"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.47.d: "The population of [byz_revolt.GetName] is up in arms. There has been continuous unrest boiling in the province since the Union between the Churches has been announced. The local population is deeply incessant and will resist any attempts at recognizing the superiority of the Pope. Many have begun chanting they would rather see the Turkish turban fly over Constantinople than be subservient to the Latins."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.47.a: "It is not like they have a choice!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.48.t: "Mending the Schism"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.48.d: "Since the Eastern and the Western Churches split in 1054, it seemed like there was no unity in sight and there wouldn't be for centuries to come. It almost seemed like the two churches would get reunited in the fifteenth century thanks to the terrible situation the Roman Empire found itself in, but it was able to return to grace, throwing off the shackles of Papal influence. Today, the Empire stands triumphant, having restored the Pentarchy and properly united the two churches, having swayed public opinion towards such outcome."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.48.a: "Wonderful."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.49.t: "The Looming Catastrophe"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.49.d: "Word has reached [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the citizens of Constantinople, that the [TUR.GetAdjective] [TUR.Monarch.GetTitle] [TUR.Monarch.GetName] has begun his march on the city with an army of Janissaries to support him. The population of the megalopolis was already prepared for this outcome, and many, even the poor, have begun solemnly praying to God to relieve the city. Processions are held from all the churches to call for divine intervention."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.49.a: "Let us hold a mass in Hagia Sophia."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.49.b: "Rally the Defenders to the walls!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.49.c: "Let us face the enemy straight on."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.50.t: "Giovanni Giustiniani"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.50.d: "Giovanni Giustiniani was the lead of the Genoese garrison, which came to the aid of the Byzantines during their darkest hour in 1453. His military prowess and the support of the hundreds of soldiers who arrived with him would be critical to the defense of the city."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.50.a: "Thanks be to God!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.51.t: "Confirmation of the Council of Florence"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.51.d: "In 1439, Ioannes travelled to Florence alongside many orthodox religious scholars to discuss the matters of mending the schism with the Pope. With mounting pressure from the Monarch determined to earn support of the Pope and his subordinates, the Byzantines agreed to formally unite the two churches and to accept the superiority of the Pope. This move, while seemingly necessary, would cause the rise of the anti-unionist faction in Constantinople, sparking wide unrest in the last days of the city."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.51.a: "We stand by our decisions."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.51.b: "Reject the union!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.52.t: "Papal Assertiveness"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.52.d: "With the darkest day looming ever closer, a letter has arrived from the Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] accusing the pledge of [Root.Monarch.GetName] of being dishonest and his actions being insufficient. He demands that the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] takes a more hawkish stance on the issue of the Union between the Churches, and only then will he call the might of the Catholic community to support us in our war."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.52.a: "Do the lip service to keep him happy."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.52.b: "That is the price we pay."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.53.t: "Unity with the Patriarchate"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.53.d: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] has finally given in, fully accepting the superiority of the Pope and promising to convert [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] population in a swift manner. As a guarantee of this agreement, several Catholic ministers were placed in the administration and Cardinal Isidore has been placed as the Patriarch of Constantinople."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.53.a: "Finally!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.54.t: "Call for a Crusade!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.54.d: "Having promised the Romans support in times of need, many expect the Holy Father to call a new crusade against the Ottomans. While the support may seem omnipresent, there are many against such a call, citing the recent loss at Varna, leaving much of Christian world disheartened."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.54.a: "Never mind the loss at Varna!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.54.b: "We cannot help the Romans."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.55.t: "In Protection of Constantinople"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.55.d: "The Holy Father has called us to a crusade against Ottomans, hoping to protect the last Roman Empire remnant from destruction. Though greatly weakened by the loss at Varna, should we not heed the call, the Ottomans might grow too powerful to contain."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.55.a: "We will honor the Papal call."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.55.b: "Ottomans are too powerful in this moment of time."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.56.t: "Landing a Pronoiar"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.56.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to land one of their generals a tract of land in the form of a pronoia grant. Pronoia grants are mostly rewarded as a token of gratitude for military service and the pronoiar is expected to take part in [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s campaigns."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.56.a: "Alright."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.57.t: "Western Support"

 MAGNIFICENT_BUILDING_STRING: "At the sight of the great [Root.GetTempleName], the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has found trouble keeping [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tears back. Indeed, neither [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] nor any of the members of the court has seen such a magnificent building in their life.\nThe outer walls are decorated in complex yet playful patterns. The door itself looks like the entrance to what some might think could be the afterlife. And the form...\nTruly, a creation which deserves to be a monument of [Root.GetName]."
 SIGNIFICANT_BUILDING_STRING: "An impressive piece of [Root.GetAdjective] craftsmanship greets the eyes of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. A building like this is rare - even within a country that is focusing so much on the high arts and cultures such as [Root.GetName].\nThe shape of the [Root.GetTempleName] speaks for the divinity of the heaven while the color represents the good in the [Root.GetAdjective] people. Not only a building for practical uses, this [Root.GetTempleName] is proof that worldly and mystical art can coexist in harmony."
 NOTEWORTHY_BUILDING_STRING: "Although interesting and beautiful in its own right, the [Root.GetTempleName] presented by the architect is not of great significance to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] nor [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] court. Still, it serves good enough to be the next object of envy from our rivals.\nThe shapes, while not as magnificent as great monuments, give the building a certain imposing aura. The coloring, too, flatters the eye while keeping it modest. It is a for certain a noteworthy building."
 GREAT_BUILDING_STRING: "Clearly, the architect exaggerated the quality and prestige his construction would bring us. His work possesses some potential, and at some spots the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can even recognize some artistic skills. Nonetheless, it is not an art piece to document for our descendants.\nThe [Root.GetTempleName] was certainly built with functionality over beauty. The shapes are kept simplistic, and, colors are nearly completely absent. Although it fulfills its purpose, it is clear that this house of beliefs is lacking a soul on its own."
 PATHETIC_BUILDING_STRING: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had to pause for a moment as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gazes upon the misconstruction presented to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. Words cannot describe [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] repulsion of the \"art\" [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] craftsman has created.\nIt resembles a [Root.GetTempleName] only in its form at best. The material used for such a building has certainly seen one too many battlefields, and its functionality is questionable at best. One of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] highness' advisor dared to enter this wretched hut, and barely escaped with his life as one of the support beams missed by one foot."
 MAGNIFICENT_CARPETS_STRING: "At the sight of the great carpets, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has found trouble keeping [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tears back. Indeed, neither [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] nor any of the members of the court has seen such a magnificent work of tailoring in their life.\nThe surface feels incredibly soft yet robust. The patterns are the sweetest candy to the eye as they give the carpet its most noble look. Truly, the tailor outdid himself!"
 SIGNIFICANT_CARPETS_STRING: "An impressive piece of [Root.GetAdjective] craftsmanship greets the eyes of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. A carpet like this is rare - even within a country that is focusing so much on the high arts and cultures such as [Root.GetName].\nThe cloth is fine, yet manages to keep its shape and color even after usage. The patterns are complex, and at times even confusing to follow, yet bring their own kind of beauty to the rug. Clearly, it is a work of great quality."
 NOTEWORTHY_CARPETS_STRING: "Although interesting and beautiful in its own right, the carpet presented by the needleworker is not of great significance to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] nor [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] court. Still, it serves good enough to be the next object of envy from our rivals.\nIts cloth is fine and delicate - too much to make the rug usable for the floor. However, its design and choice of textile make it a noteworthy ornament for the walls."
 GREAT_CARPETS_STRING: "Clearly, the tailor exaggerated the quality and prestige his rug would bring us. His work possesses some potential, and at some spots the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can even recognize some artistic skills. Nonetheless, it is not an art piece to document for our descendants.\nThe pattern of the carpet is kept simple. The surface feels rough to touch, though it makes for an excellent doormat.

Indeed, neither [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] nor any of the members of the court has seen such a magnificent art piece in their life.\nAbsolutely stunningly, the portrait depicts the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] in profile. The lines encapsulate perfectly the shape of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face while the coloring gives the portrayal an almost real feeling to it. One of the advisors noted jokingly the artist might be a charlatan as the portrait resembles more a mirror than a painting."
 SIGNIFICANT_PAINTING_STRING: "An impressive piece of [Root.GetAdjective] craftsmanship greets the eyes of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. A painting like this is rare - even within a country that is focusing so much on the high arts and cultures such as [Root.GetName].\nThe portrait depicts [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]. The lines creating the shape of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] stature recapture the aura of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] while the coloring combines both, artistic vision with the reality of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] look."
 NOTEWORTHY_PAINTING_STRING: "Although interesting and beautiful in its own right, the portrait presented by the artist is not of great significance to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] nor [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] court. Still, it serves good enough to be the next object of envy from our rivals.\nIt depicts the [Root.Monarch.GetName] standing in the throne room. However, it is clear that the painter was much more so concerned about the court itself as many other characters dilute the image. Still, it suffices more than enough to decorate the court."
 GREAT_PAINTING_STRING: "Clearly, the painter exaggerated the quality and prestige his artwork would bring us. His work possesses some potential, and at some spots the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can even recognize some artistic skills. Nonetheless, it is not an art piece to document for our descendants.\nThe picture depicts a bowl filled with apples. He calls \"still life\". Although the objective quality is clearly present, a painting of a bowl of apples still is just a painting of a bowl of apples."
 PATHETIC_PAINTING_STRING: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had to pause for a moment as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gazes upon the soiled paper presented to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. Words cannot describe [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] repulsion of the \"art\" [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] craftsman has created.\nIt depicts [Root.Monarch.GetName] - or at least that is what the artist claims. The shape of the presumed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] are all in warped. The proportions are unrealistic at best, and outright nightmarish at worst. Whatever medicines this artis was taking, it shows that he had not enough of them.\nIn an outcry of indignation, the artist claims that future generations might understand his style while our most prestigious court is too \"unenlightened to recognize the finesse of art\"."
 FALLBACK_ART_STRING: "However, when the artist had to present his work, the only thing he was able to utter were lazy excuses. Clearly, it is a crook who thinks the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a fool."

 georgian_crisis.1.t: "The Georgian Crisis"
 georgian_crisis.1.d: "In the dimly lit halls of our royal palace, the somber echoes of the King's failed attempts to restore order serve as a chilling reminder of the predicament that Georgia now faces. With each passing day, the grip of the crown slackens, its shine dulled by the tarnish of political failure and burgeoning chaos. Rumors from the west carry news of Demetrius rallying his nobles, their words seething with discontent and ambitious yearnings. His claims to the crown grow louder and more audacious, stoking the fires of an imminent conflict. Other nobles, once staunch supporters of the crown, now whisper of rebellion, their loyalty swaying in the face of uncertainty. It seems the feared crisis is upon us. With our kingdom fractured and at the precipice of civil war, we find ourselves in desperate need of decisive action. Will we regain control, or will we let the crown slip from our grasp?"
 georgian_crisis.1.a: "We will fight for our rightful rule!"
 georgian_crisis.2.t: "Order Restored"
 georgian_crisis.2.d: "The bitter echoes of rebellion have at last been silenced. With the defeat of Demetrius and his ambitious nobles, a sense of calm has returned to the land of Georgia. The king's rule, once teetering on the precipice of collapse, now stands firm once again. The royal banner flies high above the castle, a symbol of our hard-fought victory and regained control. The nobles who once sought to exploit the instability of the crown now bow their heads in surrender, their dreams of autonomy crushed under the might of our united forces. Their rebellious fire has been doused, and our king's authority remains unquestioned."
 georgian_crisis.2.a: "We have prevailed"
 georgian_crisis.3.t: "The Atabegs Break Away"
 georgian_crisis.3.d: "In the midst of the chaotic Georgian Crisis, a courier arrives from the southwestern reaches of our realm. He brings a message from the Atabegs of Samtskhe, and his grim countenance bodes ill. The Atabegs have declared their independence, unwilling to remain under the faltering rule of the Bagrationi dynasty. This daring move is a chilling example of the damage our internal strife has wrought. The separatists see the weakened state of our kingdom as an opportunity to establish their rule, free from the burdens and controls of the central authority. The blow to our sovereignty is profound, adding to the challenges we face amidst the crisis. How we respond to this affront will have far-reaching implications for the fate of our kingdom."
 georgian_crisis.3.a: "Blighted traitors!"
 georgian_crisis.3.b: "There is nothing we can do..."
 georgian_crisis.4.t: "Imereti Declares Independence"
 georgian_crisis.4.d: "The echoes of strife have given rise to a new, unsettling note: the proclamation of an independent Kingdom of Imereti. Demetrius Bagrationi, our King's own brother, appears to have turned his ambition into action. As the ruler of Western Georgia, his latest move signifies a profound and direct challenge to our crumbling authority. His call for independence reverberates through the realm, sowing discord and inspiring other would-be separatists. The bonds that once held our Kingdom together seem to be fraying at an alarming rate, the strings of loyalty cut by the sharp edge of ambition. With the realm teetering on the brink of fragmentation, we are faced with a dire decision."
 georgian_crisis.4.a: "Rally the troops, Demetrius will pay for his treachery!"
 georgian_crisis.4.b: "It is a lost cause..."
 georgia_constantinople_title: "Move the Capital to Constantinople"
 georgia_constantinople_desc: "In a momentous turn of events, the courageous nation of Georgia has emerged triumphant in the reconquest of Constantinople, reclaiming the ancient throne of the Roman Empire. As the new custodians of this historic city, a critical decision now lies before us: Shall we embrace our glorious victory by relocating our capital to Constantinople, solidifying Georgia's reign over this symbolic heart of the empire?"
 flavor_geo.1.t: "A Troubled Realm"
 flavor_geo.1.d: "Once a prominent power and unrivaled hegemon of the Caucasus, Georgia has suffered a dramatic downfall over the centuries, losing its eminent status. The prosperous era came to an abrupt end with the onslaught of the Mongols, Turks, and Timur, paving the way for a relentless fight for survival. This dwindling power was accompanied by an economic decline, leading to a desperate nobility demanding an increasing number of privileges.\n\nIn an attempt to address this issue, King Alexander I, following a time-honored Byzantine tradition, appointed his three sons as joint rulers, establishing a unique system known as a triarchy where the sons shared sovereignty over the kingdom. This arrangement, however, was short-lived as Alexander renounced his throne in 1442 and sequestered himself in a monastery.\n\nHis eldest son, Vakhtang, claimed the throne, yet with no successor to his name, the nobility and his brothers are biding their time, eagerly anticipating a chance to claim the crown for themselves. Hence, the future trajectory of our kingdom remains shrouded in uncertainty."
 flavor_geo.1.a: "We will prevail!"
 flavor_geo.2.t: "Heirs of the Romans"
 flavor_geo.2.d: "For centuries, the Byzantine Empire valiantly defended Constantinople, but now the flame of Byzantine glory flickers. The time has come for Georgia to seize the mantle, to succeed where others have faltered, and to forge a new legacy upon the storied foundations of Rome. The Georgian Reconquest envisions a triumphant return to Constantinople, a rebirth of a new Roman era, with a Georgian ruler ascending the throne, guided by the principles of righteousness, strength, and unwavering faith. In this momentous event, Georgia, fortified by its indomitable spirit and military prowess, shall become the bulwark of the Orthodox world. The new Roman legacy, shaped by Georgian hands, will rekindle the flame of Byzantine glory and breathe new life into the Orthodox faith. The walls of Constantinople, now under Georgian guardianship, shall defy the onslaught of adversaries, becoming an impregnable bastion that inspires hope and preserves the Orthodox legacy for generations to come. The world watches with bated breath as this historic chapter unfolds."
 flavor_geo.2.a: "The Phonenix rises!"
 flavor_geo.3.t: "Fall of Sarai"
 flavor_geo.3.d: "The heart of the Great Horde lays penetrated. The great city of the Khan has fallen, marking the end of the Tatar Yoke and the horde's rule over the steppe. The scourge which threatened the Christian world for many years and forced countless nations into subjugation is now a thing of history. Our brave soldiers, thirsting for revenge, are only awaiting orders to put the city to torch, turning it into a smoldering ruin, ready to be swallowed up by the steppe once again."
 flavor_geo.3.a: "Burn it to ash!"
 flavor_geo.3.b: "Take the loot to [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 flavor_geo.3.c: "Spare the city"
 flavor_geo.4.t: "Giorgi Saakadze"
 flavor_geo.4.d: "As the winds of change sweep across the Georgian lands, a name resounds throughout history: Giorgi Saakadze. Born around 1570, Giorgi Saakadze rose through the ranks to become a prominent military commander and statesman. Renowned for his unwavering spirit and exceptional leadership, he orchestrated a series of triumphs against formidable foes, defending the Georgian lands from relentless Persian and Ottoman invasions. Although somewhat controversial for his service to Safavids and Ottomans, a choice that drew criticism and divided opinions among his contemporaries, his experiences in the service of other powers have granted him a unique perspective and a wealth of knowledge. The time has come to honor this extraordinary figure. The question arises: How shall we pay tribute to Giorgi Saakadze's extraordinary legacy? Two paths lie before us:"
 flavor_geo.4.a: "Appoint him as a general"
 flavor_geo.4.b: "Engage him as an advisor"
 flavor_geo.5.t: "Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani"
 flavor_geo.5.d: "In the realm of Georgian intellect and culture, one name stands tall, embodying the essence of enlightenment, literary brilliance, and a deep passion for preserving the heritage of a proud nation: Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani. Regarded as a luminary of his time, Orbeliani's life and accomplishments have left an indelible mark on the tapestry of Georgian history. Orbeliani's written works, marked by their eloquence and depth, captured the essence of Georgian folklore, traditions, and the very soul of the nation. His masterful contributions to ethnography and folklore not only served as a testament to the richness of Georgian heritage but also played a pivotal role in preserving and revitalizing cultural identity during a time of external influences. How shall we honor this man?"
 flavor_geo.5.a: "Offer him a place at the royal court"
 flavor_geo.5.b: "We will make use of him elsewhere"
 flavor_geo.6.t: "Unrest in Samtskhe"
 flavor_geo.6.d: "Throughout the vast expanse of Georgia, tales of disorder and chaos echo through our halls. The political turmoil plaguing the central governance has not gone unnoticed, particularly by the Atabegs of Samtskhe. They gaze upon our weakened state with a newfound boldness, a defiant glint in their eyes. Discontent murmurs are growing into loud proclamations of dissatisfaction, as they condemn our unstable rule and their subjugation under it. Their loyalty, once unquestionable, now trembles on the edge of a sword, their yearning for autonomy threatening to spill over."
 flavor_geo.6.a: "We must reaffirm our authority!"
 flavor_geo.6.b: "Let them test the waters..."
 flavor_geo.7.t: "Demetrius' Ambitions"
 flavor_geo.7.d: "A courier arrives in our court, panting and sweat-soaked, bearing a scroll sealed with the emblem of Western Georgia. It is from none other than Demetrius, brother to our King Vakhtang. In his letter, he requests - or rather, demands - a substantial increase in autonomy for his lands, along with a long list of privileges for his local nobles. It is clear that Demetrius and his nobles are capitalizing on the weak state of our central rule and the uncertain future of King Vakhtang's line of succession. Their audacious demands ring with the clangor of ambition and a barely concealed desire to break away from the rule of the crown. The question now stands: How should we respond to this blatant challenge to our authority?"
 flavor_geo.7.a: "Concede to their demands for the sake of peace"
 flavor_geo.7.b: "Reject their demands"
 arm_egypt_title: "Coptic Restoration"
 arm_egypt_desc: "In the times of ancient power and glory, the Coptic Church was the bedrock of faith and culture in Egypt. Yet, centuries of foreign domination have led to the marginalization of the Coptic community, with the once prominent church's influence substantially diminished. Our Armenian crusade is not only for liberation but also for the restoration of the spiritual heart of the Coptic community. Let us restore the glory of the Coptic Church and ensure the return of the Copts to prominence in Egypt."
 arm_jerusalem_title: "Control the Holy Land"
 arm_jerusalem_desc: "The Holy Land has always been a focal point of the Christian world. Yet, it is currently under the control of forces that do not share our faith and reverence for these sacred lands. The city of Jerusalem, the symbolic heart of Christianity, must be returned to Christian hands."
 arm_mamluks_title: "Levantine Incursion"
 arm_mamluks_desc: "The Mamluks, who currently reign over the Levant, are a formidable power in the region. They stand as a strong barrier to our holy cause of expanding the Christian faith. Their rule has not only hindered our religious mission but also threatens the balance of power in the region. A crusade against them, while daunting, is the only path forward."

 arm_proclaim_great_armenia_desc: "Our great nation has come a long way, standing tall against formidable foes, reclaiming lands of religious importance, and restoring our faith to prominence. Yet, there is still a mission that beckons us, one that will bring us closer to our ancestral roots and promise a new era of prosperity - the reconquest of our ancestral lands. The provinces lost in previous centuries are not just territories; they are the heart and soul of our Armenian identity. Only by uniting these lands under our rule can we truly say that Armenia has been restored to its ancient glory. The journey will be fraught with challenges, but once completed, we can stand proudly and proclaim the advent of Great Armenia, marking the beginning of a new Golden Age."

 arm_break_osmans_legacy_desc: "The rise of the Ottoman Empire has dramatically shifted the balance of power in Anatolia. They have spread their dominion far and wide, establishing a hegemony that has stifled the growth and independence of many nations, including our own. However, every empire has its twilight, and the time has come to challenge the Ottomans and shatter Osman's legacy."

They epitomized the might and splendor of our nation in its prime. It's our duty to honor their legacy and reclaim the territories that were once under Armenian control. Persia, a land rich in culture and resources, has been a historical battleground of great empires. It is time for us to make our mark on this land. We must prepare for an incursion into Persia, driven by the ambition to expand our borders, assert our influence, and reclaim the glory of the Artaxiad era."

 melikdom_organization1_desc: "As one of the few bastions of an independent Armenian state, Armenia was governed by feudal suzerains called meliks, as the old nakharar system collapsed. The relationship between meliks and their subordinates was that of a military commanding officer and junior officer, and not of a feudal lord and a serf.

The Armenian liberators, despite their differences with the Church of the East rooted in the aftermath of the Council of Chalcedon, are proving that unity in the face of common adversity supersedes theological discrepancies.\n\nThe differences between our churches must be put aside, since the existential threats posed by the Islamic Sultanates require a unified Christian front. Even as differences in the interpretation of the nature of Christ persist, it is the emblem of the Cross that remains their shared rallying point. Our march to victory resonates with a deeper message: the power of the Cross knows no bounds, and the resolve of the faithful can lead to the most unexpected of victories.

Once the predominant Christian group in Egypt, the Copts have long been marginalized, their religious freedom curtailed under Islamic rule. Now, with Armenian forces bringing these lands under their control, the bells of the Coptic Orthodox Church ring once again across the Nile, heralding the beginning of a Coptic Restoration.\n\nWe have come to the Copts' aid, emboldening them to reclaim their historical stature. Our victory over Egypt's previous rulers not only marks the expansion of our territories but also ushers in a renewed era of religious freedom and acceptance for the Coptic Christians. Let us celebrate this momentous occasion, for it not only signifies the expansion of our Empire but also the rebirth of a faith community that has endured centuries of trials and tribulations.

Amongst them, the Seljuk dynasty shone as a beacon of greatness, governing with wisdom and valor. Centuries later, fate has bestowed upon us the opportunity to reclaim the legacy of our esteemed predecessors and unite the fragmented lands of Iran under our rule. For far too long, the usurpers of the Timurid dynasty have plagued these lands, sowing discord and chaos. But we, the rightful successors of the Seljuk bloodline, have risen to the occasion and dethroned these interlopers. Now, with Iran under our dominion, we are tasked with the responsibility of revitalizing a land ravaged by Mongol and Timurid raids, which have left Iran in a state of depopulation and internal division. If we are to become the true legitimate rulers of Persia, we must strive to mend these wounds so that we may shape history and leave a lasting mark on the land, just like our predecessors did."

It was commissioned by the illustrious Mongol ruler, Hulagu Khan, as a symbol of his commitment to advancing the realm of science and unraveling the secrets of the cosmos. Guided by the genius of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, an esteemed polymath and astronomer, the observatory became a haven for scholars from far and wide. However, the ravages of time and the ebb and flow of empires conspired to cast a shadow over this beacon of knowledge. Neglect and conflict marred its once-majestic halls, leaving it a mere shadow of its former glory. But fret not, for our enlightened reign shall herald a renaissance for the Maragheh Observatory. Under our guidance, the observatory will be meticulously restored to its former grandeur. Walls once worn by centuries of neglect shall be repaired, and the celestial instruments that once guided the gaze of scholars shall be revived. A select group of astronomers, mathematicians, and cartographers will be invited from across our realm to revive the spirit of inquiry that once thrived within these walls. The restored Maragheh Observatory shall serve as a center of astronomical research and intellectual discourse, attracting brilliant minds from far and wide. Our kingdom will bask in the glory of their discoveries, as they unravel the mysteries of the cosmos and illuminate the darkest corners of the night sky. The knowledge gleaned within these halls shall not only enrich our realm's scientific pursuits but also strengthen our position as patrons of learning and enlightenment."

His expertise caught the attention of the ruling elites, and he was appointed as an advisor and historian to both the Aq Qoyunlu and Qara Qoyunlu dynasties. During his service to the Aq Qoyunlu and Qara Qoyunlu realms, Abu Bakr Tihrani compiled his seminal work, the Kitab-i Diyarbakriyya.

The region, ripe with wealth and brimming with strategic importance, is now to be passed on to his son, Fulad Mirza, in accordance with local customs and traditions. Yet, our sovereign Jahan Shah has grand visions of a centralized realm, a singular, powerful entity united under his command. The existence of a semi-autonomous Emirate in the heart of his dominions, especially one as influential as Baghdad, could prove a thorn in his side, an unwelcome obstacle to his aspirations.\n\nTo deal with this delicate matter, we now have to make a crucial decision. We could choose to douse the embers of local rule by force, abolishing the Emirate of Baghdad, and integrating it directly into the heart of our realm. This would undoubtedly strengthen our central power, but it may also provoke the ire of other local lords and risk internal strife. Alternatively, we might seek a more peaceful route, finding diplomatic or familial ties to slowly draw the Emirate closer to our own domain without risking open conflict. This choice may buy us time and avoid immediate unrest, but leaves the question if a stable and loyal realm can be achieved without a show of force. This decision will undeniably shape the future of our realm. The sands of time have begun to pour, and we must choose our path, and soon."

Yet its populace consists mainly of Pontic Greeks, devout followers of the Orthodox Christian faith, potentially threatening the unity of our Muslim realm.\n\nAs the new rulers of Trebizond, we now face a crucial decision. We could grant local autonomy and guarantee the rights of the existing population, thereby ensuring their cooperation and maintaining the city's existing culture and prosperity. However, this approach might foster a dangerous, insular pocket of potential dissent and rebellion.\n\nAlternatively, we could promote a migration of our Muslim Turkomen brethren into the city.

The Safavids were initially a religious movement, drawing followers through their charismatic spiritual leadership. But as their influence grew, they became a political and military force to be reckoned with, and have come to dominate much of Northwestern Iran.

Known for its economic vitality and cultural significance, Tabriz offers a strategic advantage that our current capital cannot. Its advanced infrastructure, booming marketplace, and fortified location make it an ideal seat of power for our growing empire.

As reports of the Emir's increasing influence and power reach the royal court, a growing concern takes root.
